## 🔍 Scope of Security Considerations

This project includes both **classical** and **modern** cryptographic algorithms.

### Important Notes

- **Classical ciphers** (e.g. Caesar, Vigenère, Rail Fence) are:
  - Included for **educational purposes only**
  - **Not secure** for real-world use
- **Modern cryptography** implementations:
  - Use well-established libraries where possible
  - Are provided with care but **should be reviewed before production use**

The maintainers do **not** recommend using this library for protecting sensitive or regulated data without independent security review.

## 🧪 Dependencies

Cipher Toolbox relies on third-party libraries (e.g. `cryptography`).

Security updates to dependencies should be applied promptly.  
Known vulnerabilities in dependencies should be reported if they impact this project.
